(TEST 2) Echoing via --echo and COMMANDO_ECHO
COMMENTS:
Checks 3 behaviors
1. Normally commando does not echo entered commands
2. When invoked with the '--echo' options, commands are echoed
3. When the COMMANDO_ECHO environment variable is set, commands are
   echoed
Does so in a BASH terminal by feeding commands to commando from a file
on standard input.
