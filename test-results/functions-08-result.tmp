Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this       <
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the    <
proposition that all men are created equal.                            <
                                                                       <
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,  <
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are   <
met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a    <
portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here     <
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting <
and proper that we should do this.                                     <

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate   <
-- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead,   <
who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to   <
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we  <
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the <
living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they <
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us   <
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that     <
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for   <
which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here      <
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that     <
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that  <
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not     <
perish from the earth.                                                 <
