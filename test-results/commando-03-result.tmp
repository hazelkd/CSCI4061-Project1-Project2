(TEST 3) End of Input
COMMENTS:
Checks that if the end of input is reached, the program exits
correctly by printing 'End of input'. End of input is triggered
interactively by pressing 'Ctrl-d' in a terminal. In batch mode, it is
triggered by reaching the end of an input stream (file). In such
cases, C input functions like fgets() return NULL.


program: ./commando --echo
Failure messages:
- FAILURE(139) due to Kill Signal from OS: likely a SEGFAULT occured
- FAILURE: Valgrind reports reachable memory, may need to add free() or fclose()
- FAILURE: Output Mismatch at lines marked

--- Side by Side Differences ---
- Expect output in: test-results/raw/commando-03-expect.tmp
- Actual output in: test-results/raw/commando-03-actual.tmp
- Differing lines have a character like '|' '>' or '<' in the middle
